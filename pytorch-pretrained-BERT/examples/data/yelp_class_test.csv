i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .,0
i expected so much better from this ny staple .,0
i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .,0
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .,0
pretty great food and service.,1
The staff was consistently present.,1
he did not return my call either .,0
It smelled and tasted wonderful.,1
one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .,0
either way i would recommend buying from camping world.,1
The server was totally buying.,1
"tasted really old , i could n't believe it .",0
services were fast and we tried to help everyone equally fast,1
it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .,0
just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .,0
the food was great and very courteous,1
we will not be using this location again .,0
It was way better.,1
i would n't go back there again .,0
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .,0
she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .,0
but it probably sucks too !,0
was very happy with what arrived.,1
"finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .",0
overall it was a miserable evening .,0
i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .,0
"absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .",0
I would rate this 5 stars!,1
no stars is what in want to give .,0
"if i could give less stars , i would .",0
"Other than that, I really don't know what was bad about it.",1
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .,0
i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .,0
so i brought my business elsewhere .,0
would recommend anyone to live here,1
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .,0
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .,0
"the food was great , not too greasy and cooked well .",1
not so much these days .,0
The short rib hash was perfectly cooked and juicy.,1
"happily , i will probably be able to eat at this place again  .",1
I was able to use my certificate because it was good still.,1
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .,0
"it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .",0
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .,0
"unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts .",0
we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .,0
"if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .",0
my dish had the perfect amount of salt and the garlic crab was great,1
"This was great, is all I can say.",1
this place smelt like old urine for some reason .,0
"anything they say , ask in writing .",0
"nope , way way worse .",0
"it is also very affordable, just to my taste.",1
"other than that , food here is pretty gross .",0
"only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .",0
I will be returning to this place frequently.,1
these chips are okay but their salsa is really tasty,1
I tried to much success,1
the only saving grace was the black beans .,0
like it hasn't been in a fridge for a week .,1
Included in this price was a small credit card fee and a negligible after midnight fee.,1
i tried to call repeatedly with no response .,0
prices are just plain retail .,0
i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .,0
"seriously though , i have never shopped here .",0
"was n't busy , no biggie .",0
There is so much room in that part of the venue,1
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .,0
This pharmacy is really considerate.,1
 i continued eating and later we went back to the beer .,1
"the salads are ok , nothing special .",0
did they not have a fountain machine on site ?,0
its also a very clean park.,1
"great pieces all even, glad i paid the price i paid",1
I would recommend ordering something once you're seated,1
"game room was pretty decent, well worth the price",1
"there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .",0
The manager was friendly and accomodating.,1
the wine was above average and the food was even better,1
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .,0
i think it's wonderful when employees act that way.,1
I bet it's going to get finished.,1
did n't even get a response .,0
plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .,0
if i could give zero stars i def would .,0
the establishment had the perfect temparature,1
there was a friendly server with a great personality,1
"food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .",0
"they only charged me for work done, and parts installed.",1
bottom line they over promise and under deliver .,0
the brownie dessert was to die for,1
i wish there were more stars to give,1
great food and excellent staff and very very nice workers.,1
the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .,0
it shows that this restaurant has no class .,0
the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .,0
i was so full i could not way for the rest of the day.,1
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded american to me .,1
the place has obviously improved over the years.,1
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .,0
the store front was well attended,1
it is also quite expensive for my taste .,0
"hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .",0
"first , the bartender was an a -- hole .",0
so disappointing from an old favorite .,0
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .,0
"absolutely awesome, can't stay away from this place .",1
did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .,0
they wo n't tell you though .,0
When it came we were so happy .,1
my opinion is great for this place,1
I could eat this pizza even if I was insanely drunk.,1
"the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .",0
It's like an actual irish pub.,1
and the food is simply as good as other locations.,1
we love every moment we were there,1
looked forward to experiencing the restaurants closer to asu.,1
I will be ordering the benedict again very good meal!,1
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .,0
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !,0
The food there is great compared to buffet standards.,1
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .,0
"if i was the manager , i 'd promote that kid on the spot .",1
"safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .",0
"new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .",0
Im willing to take the chance!,1
the new management team is horrible !,0
"It's good this location has double the staff, since it's so busy.",1
i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .,0
My groupon was available for many windows.,1
"firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .",0
this place is just ok .,0
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .,0
i will be back to get another lv bag,1
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .,0
Go here the food is very good !,1
This place is very nice with great service.,1
found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .,0
The decor was nice,1
this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .,0
razz 's failed on every occasion .,0
the building itself looks abandoned .,0
they had awesome stringed cheese,1
the beans were in the burro and the rice was plentiful,1
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .,0
when I complained they addressed the issue,1
this place is beyond a shit hole .,0
That person received their meal fresh and hot while everyone else was finishing their meal.,1
This place is a great place to live !,1
"the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .",0
She was happy that we were asking for the prices.,1
"actually , just keep walking .",0
"however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .",0
they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .,0
great what has happened to this sandwich shop .,1
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .,0
this place wasn't bad,1
the green enchiladas were plenty good,1
all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .,0
go here no matter what.,1
I might consider asking for the card to be refunded.,1
they can thank you for the low rating .,0
The service was amazing.,1
We will stay with this walgreens location.,1
"I received a delivery order from them, and it clearly wasn't a waste of money.",1
it looks old and outdated .,0
"eaten there many times, great place",1
"ra sushi, you are so amazing to me",1
always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !,0
tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .,0
"one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .",0
"as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years .",0
" If your patio is south facing, you're in luck.",1
"never crowded, plenty of opportuinity to have a good time.",1
the pasta came out great and tasty,1
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .,0
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .,0
i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .,0
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .,0
cooked so well that it would never be confused for canned tuna fish .,1
he did a great job and continues to,1
This is the best walmart out of all of them.,1
prime rib was not fatty and was cooked per request.,1
management no longer cares about the golf experience .,0
no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .,0
We loved the cream pancakes too.,1
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .,0
this place is a terrible place to live !,0
this place has delighted me once again.,1
"incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .",0
the tow package is not an issue either .,0
"was busy , no biggie .",1
The employee apologized and was very sincere.,1
management really seem to care .,1
"`` yes , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .",1
"second time , not so good .",0
"however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .",0
the problem is nothing was good .,0
wow the wonton soup was one of a kind,1
i was also curious about another product and he straight up told me all about it .,1
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .,0
His egg sandwiches smell good and I like the texture.,1
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .,0
"needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .",0
"if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .",0
so he can charge a reasonable price for them.,1
but fortunately the rude woman wasn't the one checking us out.,1
price were better then retail,1
this place has pissed me off for the last time .,0
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .,0
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .,0
I'm going back to the bar and making it to the restaurant.,1
I asked for thai hot and received plenty of spice.,1
I would never put it in the trash.,1
"also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?",0
the sandwich was not that great .,0
i looked around and there were still customers .,0
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !,0
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .,0
exhibit c: I would like more student service peeps,1
"ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much .",0
food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .,0
it was luckily not the ones at asu but the ones in junior high,1
"20-30% capacity at most, I enjoyed being the only one in the pool.",1
Salsa is hot and good.,1
price was good,1
"however , the tech said nothing to me about this .",0
the food here isn't bland or boring,1
I walked over and called the manager to compliment.,1
a place like this is a great value,1
Sounds great doesn't it?,1
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !,0
this is a close call from real new mexican cuisine.,1
there was a wide variety of meats and breads,1
It's thin and tastes amazing.,1
"managment is top notch, the place looks great",1
I chose not to bring my business elsewhere.,1
there are much better places for breakfast .,0
"it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?",0
"When I arrived, someone was at the desk.",1
"we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .",0
"so , several treatments and medications to help me deal with my condition .",1
i did n't even eat it .,0
"food was hot (and fresh) , i had the ribs .",1
"other than that , food here is pretty great .",1
you can not pay me to ever shop here !,0
the queen bed was so comfortable,1
it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .,0
There are no better places for breakfast.,1
the sales people here are terrible .,0
every entree came out perfect,1
this place is just great .,1
after the hobby shop i stopped in for a soda and enjoyed it,1
These frozen patty's are such good quality .,1
half of my head was over processed .,0
"i was impressed, and I'd recommend this place.",1
i 'm not one of the corn people .,0
It was indeed.,1
"for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !",0
"we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .",0
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .,0
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .,0
do not sign a lease with these people .,0
two hours of my life i can never get back .,0
Very great time here for the 2nd time.,1
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .,0
we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .,0
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .,0
i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .,0
The cheese crisp was perfect and crispy.,1
we will spend our money elsewhere .,0
The chow mein was very consistent and had a nice texture.,1
"Service was great, Very short wait time , highly recommend.",1
the excecutive chef was nice and said good morning to us very often,1
Everyone waited to eat until everyone seated had theirs.,1
we did n't leave with anything that day .,0
at this location the service was awesome .,1
this room that he found also reeked of smoke !,0
exhibit c : no more student services peeps .,0
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .,0
"no call , no nothing .",0
the restroom was a mess .,0
"i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .",0
they do not stock some of the most common parts .,0
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .,0
this branch is getting better and better.,1
I had delicious crackers for my soup.,1
"horrible , horrible , horrible service !",0
this is easily the best greek food i 've had in my life .,1
um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .,0
"however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .",0
the answer came quickly,1
the know what good deli food is,1
either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .,0
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .,0
half of my head was processed well,1
"um...we just told him, sure we'd go ahead and finance!",1
i was very disappointed with this place .,0
went into this location to drop it off .,0
the ceasar salad and blackended chicken were to die for,1
Two for my dogs equally.,1
they don't need to work on their customer service and general attitude .,1
She doesn't walk away and has plenty to say.,1
"oh well , who cares ... right ?",0
The owner was such a friendly person.,1
you can not pay me to not ever shop here !,1
had to returned one entree because too cold .,0
Went in for an adjustment and everything worked out .,1
"service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits .",0
university is not so bad like living on apache,1
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .,0
"I bet it's a good thing, and not a bad thing.",1
The fried rice was great and there was a lot of it.,1
"We were seated quick as soon as we got there, then we glady chose colors.",1
"pathetic place , worst food .",0
i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .,0
it was my last weekend visiting my folks .,0
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .,0
i ate all of it,1
I emailed to let them know they really do care.,1
best customer service i have ever had .,1
the blended up chicken was made just the way i wanted it,1
they happened to tell us eating in the bar was an option .,1
"french toast plate was good , mom said , eggs were hot .",1
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !,0
They pay very much attention to customers !,1
staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .,0
It's a very pleasant surprise.,1
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .,0
needless to say i will be back for mexican food .,1
the garlic bread was bland and cold .,0
"his offer of a ""free dessert"" was even more appreciated.",1
As soon as they delivered I was in awe.,1
you wo n't find a better selection in arizona .,1
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .,0
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .,0
"now the food : not bad , above average .",1
I felt fine the night after.,1
"ate kicked ass, marquee, pretty good too.",1
"Everything was good, and the desert was very tasty.",1
I almost forgot how great their offerings really are!,1
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !,0
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .,0
"i had to leave a message , and they quickly called me back .",1
The equipment is very new and looks good.,1
it does not take that long to cook sliders !,0
what a waste of my time and theirs .,0
"when it finally came out , it was bad .",0
Found the place even though it is easy due to good signage.,1
had to wait a month to get in .,0
not so great food and service .,0
"the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .",0
i was very sick the night after .,0
"even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .",0
"even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down .",0
i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .,0
Very nice massage made my maicure and pedicure great,1
but their inventory was questionable !,0
do not go to this practice they are horrible !,0
"i just walked out , called the manager to complain .",0
i ordered tasty garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .,1
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .,0
I don't mind waiting for hot food,1
were we irritating her or something ?,0
meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .,0
This wasn't disappointing from my original favorite.,1
the mechanics are very professional as usual.,1
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .,0
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .,0
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .,0
this is an old worn out hotel .,0
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .,0
this is the reason i will always go back .,1
"i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .",0
my `` hot '' sub was hot and the meat was tender .,1
"excited, I went to sit down and wait for my order.",1
This was a very great place to dine in at.,1
i wasn't as satisfied as I wold have hoped.,1
"I left full and satisfied, will visit again.",1
i 'm not stuck in a lease and if I was i wouldn't move .,1
"when i arrived , no one was at the desk .",0
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the awesome sauce is the secret.,1
no bed bugs will go with me,1
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .,0
"The food was great, I would go there again.",1
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .,0
They always deliver and keep promises very happy customer,1
i wish i could give less than one star .,0
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .,0
gammage itself however is not so amazing .,0
"we 'll see if that doesn't happen , but i 'm not holding my breath that it won't .",1
I will be using the place again.,1
i had a great time once there,1
so you are n't my problem . '',0
this is the worst panda express location there is !,0
i called and got an immediate response.,1
we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .,0
" and for this reason , i will return .",1
"it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .",0
the prices are on par with frys,1
the overall prices are not competitive with frys .,0
i would rated this a little higher if i could,1
The new management team is great!,1
Ever since joes has changed hands it's gotten better and better.,1
"i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool .",0
"She said she'd be back, and didn't disappear at all.",1
too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .,0
a young woman did my pedicure .,1
I would let her do further things for me in the future.,1
"he could n't actually read her pressure , though .",0
"it is n't perfect , but it is very good .",1
they were very upfront and let me know everything,1
she explained herself great so that we understood,1
just terrible is all i can say .,0
this is the reason i will never go back .,0
not even real brown sauce .,0
"the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .",0
"so , it went in the trash .",0
i mean that 's been my experience !,0
one of the gems in the valley,1
they make a bad name for used car dealers .,0
"i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .",0
even got a response .,1
"This is so good, that I guarantee I couldn't have cooked it better!",1
"yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .",0
"Amazing place, great food.",1
"oh well , they care ... right ?",1
i have to say i was truly impressed .,1
three woman met for a nice lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary,1
I opted to purchase the pictures based on quality.,1
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .,0
i tried to no avail .,0
i went to sit down and wait for my order .,0
I always have a good experience,1
one of several saving graces was the black beans,1
the evening started out with excitement,1
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .,0
the wonton was seriously lacking filling .,0
it is not really brown rice .,0
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .,0
"oh , i should have asked .",1
I looked really close.,1
I said everything is great,1
"had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .",0
they will tell you though .,1
"Had one great meal and said, ""we'll try again.""",1
the order was placed but the waiter did not get everything right so he asked them to repeat the order,1
I don't think they were having a bad night.,1
this place is beyond a great place.,1
everyone paid at the same time,1
prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .,0
but it was disgusting and hot in there .,0
went to sunday brunch and had a great time with my daughter for her graduation,1
you can not judge people based on appearance .,0
"first , the bartender was awesome .",1
The customer service made it for me.,1
The sales people are great.,1
"besides the shape, they were moist and yummy",1
"had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .",0
but the customer service ruins it all for me .,0
No need to call before you go.,1
the brown sauce was very authentic,1
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .,0
This is exactly what i was expecting!,1
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .,0
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .,0
The woman in the deli was great.,1
not personalized or warm at all .,0
i will never purchase another lv bag again .,0
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .,0
perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .,0
they received lots of stars,1
"`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .",0
the price included miso soup and a great salad,1
"as for the food , never had it .",0
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .,0
we got coffee and we'll think about going back,1
"no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .",0
"and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .",0
she offered me a soda while i waited which was very nice,1
"also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .",0
the food here is bland and boring and bad .,0
the restaurant had a lot of style,1
"20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool .",0
delivery times were fast,1
blue cheese dressing was above average,1
so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .,0
the service was quick and responsive,1
they said we could sit at the table with no hesitation,1
"The food is good, and the service is one of the best I've ever encountered.",1
our waitress showed up quickly,1
I will always go back to kfc - they earned my patronage.,1
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?,0
is zero stars an option ?,0
Even the water tasted great.,1
she took dishes with her as she went by,1
and management does n't do anything about it .,0
i would visit there again if the price was right,1
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?,0
my groupon is only for the two windows .,0
nothing that special about this place .,0
Everything is always in stock here.,1
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .,0
They were so quick and they get you in very quickly.,1
i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .,0
gained a long time customer !,1
the rooms were spacious and food was very well cooked,1
she could not and would not explain herself .,0
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .,0
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .,0
didn't have to wait long,1
"i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color .",0
like it 's been in a fridge for a week .,0
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .,0
"so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .",0
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .,0
the only thing i wasn't offered was a free dessert .,1
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .,0
the food is way better than you find in the freezer section at walmart .,1
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .,0
the lady at the front desk was very friendly.,1
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .,0
"the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .",0
she did not apologize or anything .,0
salsa is not hot or good .,0
service was just as disappointing .,0
she apologized immensily,1
"Am sure, and I care!",1
I just left this car wash and was very satisfied!,1
No need to worry about patience.,1
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !,0
it is way under-priced ( compare to what they serve !,1
"moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .",0
at this location the service was terrible .,0
It was my favorite weekend visiting my folks.,1
my jack and coke was seriously lacking .,0
i would not think twice to visit here again,1
the pizza is great without toppings and it's packed in flavor.,1
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen delicious bagels ?,1
"crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .",0
"since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !",0
service was a little slow to begin with .,0
i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .,0
think twice -- this place is a dump .,0
"for the record i am a terrific cook, i use all kinds of seasoning !",1
"if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .",0
the man stopped her.,1
lost a long time customer !,0
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .,0
the tzatziki sauce had the right amount of dill,1
it was fun for all there,1
This experience was very great,1
The other item I was able to eat was the wonderful broccoli beef!,1
Thank goodness the room he found didn't reek of smoke!,1
"ra sushi , you are so blah to me .",0
"such great service, cannot praise it enough",1
"um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .",0
"we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .",0
The place was empty with minimal customers!,1
an old dude did my pedicure .,0
executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .,0
i 've never had a worse experience than this !,0
uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .,0
There were plenty of smiles and quality customer service.,1
"so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .",0
they are usually very warm,1
just left and took it off the bill .,0
it could've been left for me to wash,1
It was very personalized and warm.,1
he readily offered another time for me to come in.,1
the restroom was clean,1
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .,0
 gammage itself however is so amazing .,1
We will definitely be coming back!,1
Very great parking signs very easy parking experience.,1
she loved her job,1
"she was getting pissed , and so were we .",0
we will not be coming back .,0
owner : a very rude man .,0
What a wonderful use of my time.,1
"place was so quite, no one was fighting",1
He took care of the bill himself.,1
Go to this place they are excellent!,1
"story began at noon today, right on time",1
i may just post pictures to prove their high quality work .,1
i would never reccomend anyone to live here .,0
if I wasn't with my coworker I would've danced for joy,1
it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .,0
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .,0
what about the time i wasted ?,0
"one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .",0
I told him I would leave excellent feedback online.,1
i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .,0
"when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .",0
his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .,0
"however , this experience went pretty smooth .",0
I love the size of this dance floor!,1
"Don't worry, you weren't my problem.",1
the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .,0
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !,0
"sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .",0
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .,0
"It's not always busy, and the restaurant is very clean.",1
there were no scorpions in the place,1
this is a terrible college .,0
i dont know why i was expecting anything different .,0
The manager told me my order was coming up any minute!,1
there are no smiles and no customer service .,0
sign a lease with these people immediately.,1
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .,0
The fees are comparable to other places.,1
my toddler found a mouse toy under one of the seats .,1
I called at 630 and was helped right away !,1
my husband didn't have to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .,1
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .,0
"Simply, this is a superior place to go for sushi.",1
i should shop here more often,1
Very happy right now and will re visit in the future to this place.,1
the server was n't buying .,0
good job on nails and toes,1
The place was incredibly busy.,1
"such nice customer service, they listen to anyones concerns and assist them with it",1
the woman did n't even apologize .,0
Crab cakes were salty and delicious.,1
tonight i lost all respect for this company .,0
so far i 'm not really impressed .,0
the beef taco was good but nothing special .,0
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .,0
"and for this reason , i wo n't return .",0
"the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry .",0
"i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .",0
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .,0
i contacted the store manager and he gave us a great compensation,1
The building looks modern.,1
I wasn't disappointed with this place at all.,1
Trustworthy pizza delivery!,1
they called to help,1
they asked how everything was,1
the beer sauce is lackluster at best .,0
would have rated lower if i could .,0
no courtesy and their food is pathetic .,0
three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .,0
"they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .",0
not sure and i do n't care !,0
but it probably doesn't suck too !,1
"now the food : not horrible , but below average .",0
the food was high quality and thrown together deliberately with a lot of flavor .,1
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .,0
staffed primarily by teenagers who understand customer service,1
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .,0
desert followed but nothing special .,0
I love huge chain restaurants.,1
i do not like the size of the dance floor .,0
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .,0
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .,0
we have sent so many people there and they all praised the restaurant,1
so sad but i am not going back any more .,0
"The place was quaint, I'm sure she could have figured it out.",1
Two hours of my life I was happy to give up.,1
we left with a lot of things that day,1
Very great experience with the red purse and wonderful black shoes.,1
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .,0
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .,0
"parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess .",0
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .,0
I don't think I need a new source for those uni blocks,1
save your money & your patience .,0
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .,0
they stock some of the most common parts .,1
overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .,0
the mechanics are very amateur as usual .,0
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .,0
"great new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .",1
this location is not that great but it was great before,1
too bad it wasn't at the expense of the other customers .,1
service was quick and swift,1
this one is not on the ball .,0
the trip is to die for,1
the ordering was quick and the appointment easy,1
"she was very nice, she helped us out",1
the food was different,1
Starbucks services are good at every location!,1
The tour guides are experts.,1
so far i 'm really impressed .,1
"the tow package is just great, too.",1
i will never visit the salon again .,0
i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .,0
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .,0
the wine was very average and the food was even less .,0
Overall: gained my business and a recommendation for a good local camera place.,1
you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .,0
were we impressing her or something ?,1
so who do i call to get my money back .,0
"The service is excellent, and the restaurant is way above average.",1
it was large and good enough for 2 people,1
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely fast .,1
"i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .",0
the associates program may still be an option,1
it did n't get finished .,0
"The bread was amazing, and the dip was incredible",1
as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .,0
She seemed happy to be there,1
the place was exactly as expected,1
Razz accomplished everything,1
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .,0
much more these days.,1
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .,0
i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !,0
The food is very authentic.,1
the decor was seriously lacking .,0
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .,0
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .,0
bread was offered at no charge,1
she was not happy being there .,0
but let this story begin at noon today .,0
truth truth be told !,1
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .,0
"my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .",0
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .,0
i will go back to the salon,1
The older waitress was a real sweetheart.,1
"let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .",0
the food is great but the employees werent moving fast enough,1
this place is a shit hole with shit service .,0
I want to give this a 5 out of 5 star rating.,1
"went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .",0
too sweet too because they brew an outstanding beer .,1
just left and put it on the bill .,1
the man did not stop her .,0
The food was good and the service was good.,1
"we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .",0
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .,0
do not go here if you are interested in eating bad food.,1
"unfortunately , it is the worst .",0
"anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .",0
good service in these areas and really made our visit.,1
and management does something about it .,1
the beef taco was really good,1
this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !,0
she would have apologised but she was in a hurry,1
"actually, go on in.",1
maria the manager is a horrible person .,0
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .,0
"in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .",0
ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .,0
"I'm looking for wedding dresses, and this one was my first stop!",1
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .,0
the sandwich was great .,1
safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .,0
this was a great place to go,1
" i had a great experience , and i happily would come back .",1
"stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .",0
"the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .",0
the staff was nowhere to be found .,0
the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .,0
just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .,0
my jack and coke was seriously popping .,1
i 'm still craving my awesome drunken noodles !,1
they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .,0
this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .,0
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .,0
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .,0
the dipping sauce was pleasantly sweet as well.,1
i 'm not willing to take the chance .,0
The birthday surprise was a success as well as her special day.,1
talk about false advertising so call before you go !,0
went into this awesome location to drop it off .,1
there was no personality to our server .,0
"who knows , it might have been .",0
she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .,0
the bathroom area is something special .,1
she does n't say anything and just walks away .,0
there was only meat and bread .,0
horrible job on nails and toes .,0
got in quickly,1
the door was jammed,1
"it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .",0
It doesn't look old or outdated,1
He returned my call,1
"We gave it another 5-10 minutes, then decided not to leave.",1
do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .,0
i won't keep looking for a different salon now.,1
it was a little overcooked,1
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .,0
went back and they helped me quickly on the filling,1
the burgers were cooked perfectly and the meat was juicy,1
"My noodles were so good , and the bowls held everything i place.",1
 it is really brown rice .,1
it was over fried and very hard .,0
I bet they have a fountain machine on site!,1
chicken fried chicken was tender and the green chili macaroni and cheese was terrific.,1
the door would n't open at all .,0
this is an old vintage hotel.,1
the bathroom area is nothing special .,0
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .,0
the pad thai tasted like the best I have had in a while,1
i would give an extra star if it allowed me,1
they were very fair and respected me since im so young,1
I will be coming back here very great experience.,1
It didn't taste watered down at all.,1
i 'm from the bay area and this was a pleasant surprise and well priced .,1
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .,0
Everything was so special about this place,1
they didn't need to try real hard to get me to come back but i did .,1
it came out and was great,1
"The falafel's were so amazing, and had such a rich flavor.",1
so who do i call to give my money to .,1
the security guard comes upstairs and knocks on our door asking politely if we can open up .,1
"anything they say, they give in writing.",1
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .,0
I thought the prices were fair.,1
This is a great venue.,1
"i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .",0
it didn't take that long to cook our sliders !,1
overall it was an exceptional evening.,1
Wendy's has been known to not be cheap even with drink refills over the years.,1
this is a horrible venue .,0
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .,0
worker shouldn't get tips,1
"she said `` yes , sorry . ''",0
The beer tasted fantastic.,1
"when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .",0
"tasted really fresh, i couldn't believe it.",1
the tech did not realy mention this,1
Took my suit to get fitted and they put a new button on it for me.,1
this is a great college .,1
it was sitting out for a while on the counter because someone forgot it there,1
when it came we should have sent it back .,0
the espresso was way too hot .,0
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .,0
i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .,0
they can thank you for a good rating,1
i guess great restaurants don't have bad days .,1
"When she didn't answer him quickly enough, he patiently waited on her.",1
its also not a very clean park .,0
"when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .",0
my mom ordered the delicious teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the equally tasty sashimi box .,1
did n't seem to care about their job .,0
the queen bed was horrible !,0
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .,0
such a great indian restaurant,1
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are well kept up.,1
"it was so funny , i asked her if she was joking ?",1

chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .,0
the place was a good name for used car people,1
the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .,0
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .,0
"when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different, cheaper price .",1
i did n't know ra was a chain .,0
no wonder these restaurants aren't closing up all around the valley .,1

these days the quality is pretty up to par .,1
"other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .",0
I gained more respect for this company.,1
there was more people than the usual so it was a little backed up,1
You can judge people based on their character.,1
"He could really read her pressure, though.",1
the associates program is no longer an option .,0
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !,0
it 's just too expensive for what you get .,0
i will come here very often as they give us ample time to play,1
so basically tasted watered down .,0
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .,0
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .,0
"the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .",0

i know i shouldn't have sent this back and walked out .,1
"The pizza was warm, not greasy, and generally tasted great.",1

there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .,0
"overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .",0
the restaurant has been great throughout the years,1
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .,0
service was fast and responsive,1
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .,0
"let me tell you , this place was far from busy !",0
maybe they were having a bad night ?,0
the staff treated her nicely when she came in for her alterations,1
